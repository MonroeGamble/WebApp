# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
# - ONLY main branch deploys to GitHub Pages
# - Feature branches are blocked from deployment
# - Pull requests get build validation only (no deployment)
# - Manual deploys allowed via workflow_dispatch
# ============================================================================
